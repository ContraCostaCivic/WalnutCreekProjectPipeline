# WalnutCreekProjectPipeline

## Objective
Create an ongoing way to convert the Cityâ€™s static PDF Project Pipeline of development projects in town into an interactive map or other easier-to-interpret tool. 

## Resources
http://www.walnut-creek.org/departments/community-and-economic-development/planning-zoning/new-development-projects has both the Project Pipeline document, updated quarterly by staff members, and the Esri map with information about major new development projects, also updated by staff every few months. The Esri story map is not tied to the PDF project pipeline, so both are individually updated currently.
